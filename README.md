# Face-Recognition-Algorithms

This repository includes Eigenfaces and Tensorfaces algorithms for face recognition. These numerical methods use different matrix and tensor singular decompositions which are explained in detail in the scientific article "Facial Recognition using Tensor-Tensor Decompositions" by K. Braman and R. C. Hoover.

Both algorithms have been tested on the Yale Face Database. Image dataset is consisted of 70 images (7 different expression photographs for 10 persons).
